This is a work in progress that generates plot of cfos density data across three experiments: 30 session iTBS (cohort 6), 1 session iTBS (cohort 5), and 1 session cTBS (cohort 5). `/scripts/` contains gather_cfos_data.py, which will gather cfos data from our networked attached server (NAS). Currently the paths are specific to my computer but future commits will implement an argparse-based approach.
