This is a work in progress that generates plot of cfos density data across three photoexcitation groups: 30 session iTBS (cohort 6), 1 session iTBS (cohort 5), and 1 session cTBS (cohort 5). Plots are found in `/results/` and source data are located in `/data/`.  `/scripts/` contains gather_cfos_data.py, which will gather cfos data from our server. Currently the paths are specific to my computer but future commits will implement an argparse-based approach.
